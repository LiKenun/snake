# Snake
A classic-looking game of Snake written in Java written by Kevin Li, Martin Liang, Asra Pervaiz, and Naheed Reyyhad.

Compile with your favorite Java IDE or from the terminal using Maven.

Run from the terminal prompt using `java -jar snake.jar` (where `snake.jar` is the name of the compiled JAR file). Alternatively, on Windows, you may simply double-click the JAR file to run it.
